Toolkit: Toolkit is an abstract class in Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) package.
It provides a common interface for accessing system-dependent resources such as the screen size, mouse, and keyboard.

The Dimension class is part of the java.awt package,
which is the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for Java.

getDefaultToolkit(): This method is a static method of the Toolkit class.
It returns the default toolkit for the current platform.
This toolkit provides access to system resources.

getScreenSize(): This method is part of the Toolkit class.
It returns the size of the screen in pixels as a Dimension object.
The Dimension object contains width and height fields representing the screen size.

setPreferredSize(): overrides the BorderLaylut and actually changes the sizws of the panels to
the ones you set them to be. setSize() doesn't do that

set(index, element):
index: The index at which the specified element is to be inserted.
element: The element to be stored at the specified index.

    // turn section into arrayList, each task will have a section assigned by its index, each time new section created
    //it gets assigned an index, when displaying section with num of tasks, you're essentially displaying a counter
    //counter of how many tasks have that specific index

        //add label TASKS DUE TODAY to centerPanel
//        JLabel todayTask = new JLabel("Tasks due today: ");
//        todayTask.setPreferredSize(new Dimension (300, 50));
//        todayTask.setFont(fontText);
